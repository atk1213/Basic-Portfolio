        My name is Anthony Kim. I am a 27 year old male currently working in the dental field. I studied biology and medical anthropology 
        during my undergraduate studies at the University of California in Irvine. Upon graduation, I studied emergency medicine and got my 
        EMT-B certificate. Upon learning that transporting patients to hospitals was not my passion, I began working as a dental assistant and
        studied for the dental admissions exam. Although my scores were not bad, this again was not my passion. Although my heart was in 
        healthcare, I found that I was continuously drawn to technology even within medicine and dentistry. I began noticing that there were a 
        lot of inadequacies in the digital space around healthcare. I began looking into websites, apps, and programs in dentistry and medicine
        and found that it was an area that, in my opinion, could use improvement. I'm hoping to utilize my volunteer and work experience in
        healthcare with the skills I can learn through this program to bring at least a little bit of improvement.
