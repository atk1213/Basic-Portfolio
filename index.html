        <p>
        My name is Anthony Kim. I am a 27 year old male currently working in the dental field. I studied biology and medical anthropology 
        during my undergraduate studies at the University of California in Irvine. Upon graduation, I studied emergency medicine and got my 
        EMT-B certificate. Upon learning that transporting patients to hospitals was not my passion, I began working as a dental assistant and
        studied for the dental admissions exam. Although my scores were not bad, this again was not my passion. Although my heart was in 
        healthcare, I found that I was continuously drawn to technology even within medicine and dentistry. I began noticing that there were a 
        lot of inadequacies in the digital space around healthcare. I began looking into websites, apps, and programs in dentistry and medicine
        and found that it was an area that, in my opinion, could use improvement.
